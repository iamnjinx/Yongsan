  Entities:
  - ProjectName: Pillow and Headset
    Nickname: Annyong
    Description: This is a comfortable pillow and headset for enjoying music while
      lying down. I'd love to make Yongsan Park feel like my own home, where I can
      comfortably lie down and enjoy music.
  - ProjectName: Honey
    Nickname: siruren
    Description: Yongsan has various types of flowers and trees. While residents
      live in an urban area, the U.S. military base has plenty of green spaces. Surprisingly,
      Yongsan residents love growing flowers and you can find them in every house
      on rooftops and balconies. I wish there were urban beekeeping facilities, field
      learning centers, and educational facilities around Yongsan Park, enhancing
      the connection between the inside and outside of the park, just like the way
      bees move from flowers to trees.
  - ProjectName: Korean_envoy
    Nickname: siruren
    Description: 'I hope to see traces of the route that used by the Chosun envoys
      and Lee Mong-ryong when they traveled to Jeolla Province which remains at Yongsan
      Park. There are many parks in Korea but only a few of them incorporates historical
      significance and present it as their own identity. I wish for Yongsan Park
      to capture at least some of those (historical) aspects. If reenacting the entire
      route is challenging, connecting presumed locations on the ground would be
      okay at least. '
  - ProjectName: Korean Quaran
    Nickname: siruren
    Description: Near Yongsan, there are friends from diverse cultural backgrounds
      who endure hardships in Korea due to differences in appearance, while just
      across the street, there are also friends from different cultural backgrounds
      who have access to the best education with expensive tuition. I hope there
      are spaces or facilities that can bridge gaps within the multicultural community
      and address prejudices. Children from different cultural backgrounds are also
      the future of South Korea, and it is disheartening that discrimination and
      misunderstandings they face are often overlooked. We need to recognize this
      as a national issue and a concern for the future. When planning for the national
      park, I suggest providing pick-up buses or special facilities for those children
      who were previously considered troublesome at school
  - ProjectName: Reusables
    Nickname: 'siruren '
    Description: I want this national park to be designated as a plastic-free zone.
      The Han River Park is already suffering from litter issues. Yongsan Park, as
      a national park, will likely have people who bring disposable items and discard
      them in trash bins. Even within the park, efforts should be made to enforce
      significant fines for littering and irresponsible use of disposable items.
  - ProjectName: Spam
    Nickname: siruren
    Description: Spam is a food that holds significant memories not only for Koreans
      but also for Americans. After the US military came to Korea, they shared lots
      of cultures with Koreans and also experienced the same wars. While Spam serves
      as a common thread of both country, Korea has its own version of Spam (plant-based
      Spam), and the US has their own perspective. I hope Yongsan Park preserves
      and presents its dark heritage by exhibiting and explaining relics, remains,
      and repurposed artifacts from its past as a former US military base, showcasing
      how it has been absorbed and projected onto Koreans.
  - ProjectName: Blank
    Nickname: Sue
    Description: I read articles about various facility development plans are dealt
      prior to the opening of Yongsan Park. I agree that it should be a historically
      significant space, but I lamented the fact that we are not trying to have spaces
      of emptiness. I wish we could have an attitude of slowing down in this era
      of excess. Perhaps what Yongsan Park needs most is spaces of emptiness. I hope
      Yongsan Park can become a place where people can catch their breath and find
      solace in this dense city.
  - ProjectName: My Home
    Nickname: Sue
    Description: "I left the house where I had lived for over 15 years and moved
      to a different place. Even my family moved to another city as well, so that
      house is no longer my house. While \"hometown\" may generally refer to a larger
      category, including the surrounding region or home, to me, the concept of hometown
      is strongly associated with the images \u2018Inside a home\u2019. I wanted
      to talk about the hometown I can no longer visit."
  - ProjectName: Aspiration
    Nickname: Sue
    Description: "I believe the common desire of those inside and outside Yongsan
      Park must have been a sense of \u2018Aspirations\u2019. Although they may have
      wished for different things from different perspectives, the act of earnestly
      longing for something takes a similar form. This bracelet is a Buddhist prayer
      bead that my family filled with their wishes for my happiness. I am not a Buddhist,
      but I carry it with the feeling of living under the protection of my family.
      Yongsan Park is filled with the aspirations of individuals, families, the nation,
      and the people."
  - ProjectName: Peach Sandwich
    Nickname: Yeoni
    Description: This is my favorite sandwich. Although it has expanded and move
      to Hanyang University Station now, it used to be a small shop called 'Breadrum'
      near Hongik University Station on the Gyeongui Line. The shop was so small
      that it had only one bench where you could wait for your bread without a proper
      seating area. The sandwiches were so delicious that I used to go there often.
      As my home was far away, I couldn't go back to eat, and there was no place
      to sit and eat inside the shop, so I would sit on the bench at the park near
      Gyeongui Line and enjoy my sandwich (sometimes alone, sometimes with friends).
      Whenever I see someone else sitting on a bench and eating like I did, I felt
      some unspoken connection, even though we are strangers. (Ah, they must know
      how to enjoy food.) When the shop moved to Hanyang University, they added tables
      inside, and the sandwiches are still delicious, but it doesn't bring back the
      same nostalgic memories as before. Good parks always have delicious sandwich
      shops nearby. I wish there was a peach sandwich vendor at Yongsan Park. I want
      everyone to recognize how delicious this peach sandwiches are! I want to enjoy
      tasty food with many people!"
  - ProjectName: Mondoongie (Idol Lightstick)
    Nickname: Yeoni
    Description: Although I'm not currently a member of any fandom, I have rooted
      for several boybands. I could quickly break down barriers and become friends
      with strangers; age and occupation didn't matter. We would sit on street benches
      and talk for hours or lay down on mats in Sangam Square, staying up all night
      together. Those experiences left a strong impression on me, and that's why
      I chose this object. I once had nail art of MONSTA X logo and characters, and
      someone in the fandom posted a picture that she/he found MONBEBE hand on their
      regular shop's Instagram. I felt quite proud of that. I wish someone would
      feel a sense of intimacy upon seeing my MONSTA X-themed items.
  - ProjectName: Rockingbench
    Nickname: Yeoni
    Description: This is one of my favorite benches at Gwanggyo Lake Park. There
      are many rocking benches in the park (lined up in a row), and sitting on one,
      gently swinging my legs while gazing at the lake fills me with joy! The park
      is always bustling with people, but most of them are constantly moving, passing
      each other by. However, those of us sitting on the rocking bench at the same
      time are enjoying the same view and engaging in the same activity in that moment
      creating a sense of connection, as if we are sharing the same experience together.
  - ProjectName: Orpheus
    Nickname: Yeoni
    Description: This item may differ slightly from other objects, but I still want
      to include it. It's a book I absolutely adore, and every time I read it, tears
      flow. It's a book that I believe has pages that anyone can relate to. When
      thinking about relationships or loss, this particular page comes to mind. It's
      a book for those who want to quietly feel sadness alone, perfect for someone
      seeking solace in Yongsan Park.
  - ProjectName: Meteo shower (Aurora moodlight)
    Nickname: Yeoni
    Description: "One of my favorite movies is 'Comet\u2019. The main characters
      first meet at a meteor shower event held at a cemetery park. The dialogue where
      the female lead describes a \"wonderful night\" as like this, \u201CIt's something
      that feels comfortable, yet familiar and touching. Everything seems to be in
      perfect.\u201D This mood-light reminds me of that scene and makes me want to
      lie in the park, watching a meteor shower, just like that scene."
  - ProjectName: Pile of Books
    Nickname: Yoda
    Description: "These are the books I am currently reading. They are great books,
      and I wanted to share them with others through the \u2018Dreaming Yongsan Park\u2019.
      I imagine a day when I can spend leisurely time reading books in the virtual
      world's park."
  - ProjectName: Guitar and Amp
    Nickname: Yoda
    Description: Outdoor public spaces are supposed to be for citizens, but in practice,
      those places are often restricted by public institutions. Even in parks, we
      must abide by noise regulations enforced by public authorities when enjoying
      performances, legitimate protests, or spending quality time with friends. In
      the virtual Yongsan Park, I hope there can be free music performances without
      police intervention.
  - ProjectName: Fringe Office
    Nickname: Yoda
    Description: "This is the office of Fringe Festival which is located in Seoul
      Innovation Park. As the Seoul Innovation Park is set to close this year, we
      have to move office soon to another place. I wanted to capture the traces and
      belongings of the staff before it disappears. I hope to move this office to
      the \u2018Dreaming Yongsan Park\u2019"
  - ProjectName: Vegan donut
    Nickname: Yoda
    Description: This is image of Matcha-flavored vegan donut. It is a food I would
      love to enjoy on a picnic with friends at Yongsan Park in the future. It symbolizes
      the hope for having more vegan restaurants which currently are hard to find
      in Korea.
  - ProjectName: Walkman
    Nickname: Yoda
    Description: As technology advances, I also wish to bring old machines to the
      virtual world. Perhaps someone who once worked at the former US military headquarters
      used this Walkman.
  - ProjectName: Books
    Nickname: Ganga
    Description: As a park located in the heart of Seoul, I thought it would be great
      to have facilities that cater to the citizens first. So, the first thing that
      came to my mind was books. Whether it's a library, a book-sharing facility,
      or a self-service book rental system, I imagined citizens sitting on park benches,
      freely reading books, and that's why I chose this idea.
  - ProjectName: Film Camera and Photostudio
    Nickname: Ganga
    Description: If this public space opens in the center of Seoul, many people will
      spend time here or pass through. Eventually, the space will be imbued with
      traces of people, and within it, countless experiences and memories will be
      created. I scanned a film camera, thinking that leaving such records would
      be wonderful. Trendy photo studios are nice in these days but, I think having
      a more analog-style photo booth or photography studio would be great.
  - ProjectName: Cultural Diversity
    Nickname: Ganga
    Description: Next to Yongsan Park is Itaewon, a symbolic area known for embracing
      cultural diversity. I thought it would be great if Yongsan Park could also
      emphasize such values. I don't have specific events or buildings in mind, I
      envision a park that welcomes and embraces the diversity, immigrants, emigrants
      and international students who are living with us. I chose this object to hope
      Seoul has such images that celebrates and encompasses this cultural diversity.
      It would be wonderful.
  - ProjectName: Special exhibition Kit
    Nickname: Ganga
    Description: "I also scanned a kit from the recent exhibition I visited at North
      Seoul Museum of Art, titled \"What Would You Do Now?\". The exhibition offered
      a unique experience based solely on the active participation of visitors. Instead
      of following a fixed route, I could wander around exploring places of my interest
      on the map. The entire process was quite enjoyable. Moreover, the kit\u2019s
      minimal and charming design made it worthy of being kept as a collectible.
      I hope such special exhibitions with unique approaches could be held at Yongsan
      Park as well."
  - ProjectName: Shelter
    Nickname: Ganga
    Description: As the Yongsan Park is the largest park in Seoul, I think we need
      most is a "free public shelter for citizens " Nowadays, using specific outdoor
      spaces often requires a significant amount of money, which is why I chose chairs
      as the object. It represents the need for a free and open space for people
      to rest and relax.
  - ProjectName: Instrument
    Nickname: Kevin
    Description: This is my ukulele at home. I thought it would be nice to have an
      instrument here, as it's common to see people playing instruments in parks
      or squares overseas. Since Yongsan Park used to be a US military base, I wanted
      to bring a touch of romantic daily life that one might experience in another
      country. If we could have frequent outdoor performances, it would enrich people's
      daily lives and leave them with fond memories and impressions of Yongsan Park.
  - ProjectName: Car barrier rocks
    Nickname: Lucy
    Description: 'This is Car barrier rocks. At some point, I noticed vehicles started
      occupying the city. I remembered the days when Sinchon''s car-free street,
      once dedicated to pedestrians and culture, disappeared. The place that had
      started with pedestrians and culture is now gone. I want to block vehicles
      entirely in the park to create a safer and more imaginative space. I want this
      car barrier rocks in entire park. '
  - ProjectName: Flower
    Nickname: Lucy
    Description: I hope Yongsan Park is filled with flowers, butterflies, and bees.
      Instead of having strictly planned and segmented gardens, I wish for a warm
      garden where various flowers can be seen all year round. I hope children can
      run and play and experience diverse flowers. Especially in places like Yongsan,
      filled with gray buildings, I wish for more warm colors.
  - ProjectName: Children
    Nickname: Lucy
    Description: As I couldn't take pictures of real children, I used a doll instead.
      It feels like children are disappearing from the world. Not just that their
      numbers are decreasing, but the places where children can go are also disappearing.
      There are too many kid-free zones in Korea, and there are too many roads filled
      with speeding vehicles. I wish children could go anywhere, especially at a
      park.
  - ProjectName: Sewoon Building
    Nickname: Lucy
    Description: This image captures the front part of Sewoon building, which I felt
      was essential to scan, despite not being an ideal candidate for 3D scanning.
      The old markets in Euljiro are all being torn down, and unfortunately, their
      historical significance is not being adequately preserved. The focus seems
      to be solely on real estate development. However, Sewoon building stands as
      a testament to the city's history, as it was constructed when Seoul became
      a city, and it continues to serve as a significant place in someone's life
      and work. Though it stands proudly today, there is a possibility that it might
      eventually fall victim to the greed of capitalism. In such a scenario, I sincerely
      wish we could relocate it to Yongsan Park, ensuring its preservation and continuation
      of its historical significance and life in there.
  - ProjectName: Stele
    Nickname: Lucy
    Description: "Although this monument originally stood in front of Jongmyo, I
      scanned it because I felt the need to scan \u2018Stele\u2019. The Yongsan Tragedy
      in 2009 and the existence of a brothel called Jipchanchon right in front of
      Yongsan Station are part of this painful history. Despite the shining new buildings
      and structures that now dominate Yongsan, we must not let this history vanish.
      We must remember the Yongsan Tragedy and Jipchanchon. We should honor the memory
      of the people who lost their lives. We should confront violence."
  - ProjectName: Draft Beer
    Nickname: MK
    Description: The difference between a popular neighborhood park like Hangang
      Park and nearby residents' quality of life (and real estate prices) from afar
      is the content, in my opinion. I think it's like "chimaek" (Korean-style fried
      chicken and beer). If Yongsan Park allowed drinking beer, I would really go
      there to enjoy some beer.
  - ProjectName: A bench that we can lie on
    Nickname: MK
    Description: There's a concept called "defensive architecture." It refers to
      the installation of spikes or partitions on benches to make homeless people
      leave. In fact, it makes everyone uncomfortable... It's a design that drives
      homeless people away to maintain the city's aesthetics. I believe it reflects
      how we perceive civil society and how we categorize "qualified citizens" and
      "disruptive elements" in our cities.
  - ProjectName: Car barrier sign
    Nickname: MK
    Description: I often feel that this city is designed for cars. It's like a modernist
      urban plan. But if we assume that people from the age of 30 to 60 drive cars
      during their lifetime, the time spent using public transportation would be
      much longer, right? We simply drive during our strong years and walk during
      our weaker years. We need to create a more pedestrian-friendly city.
  - ProjectName: Phonebox
    Nickname: MK
    Description: Smartphones are like an extension of our bodies in modern society.
      Without our own phones, there's hardly anything we can do. That's why I hoped
      for public phone booths in Yongsan Park. I wanted to make people think about
      those who can't even use the "obvious" things.
  - ProjectName: Santa
    Nickname: MK
    Description: How much of Yongsan Children's Park is actually designed for children?
      I wish there were a Santa Claus. Not a stern Big Brother-like figure, but a
      Santa Claus who watches over and encourages children, making them look forward
      to Christmas.
  - ProjectName: Boat Table
    Nickname: Dalvory
    Description: Sitting on a cushion at the top of Dungsan Mountain, enjoying the
      view of the park, would be great.
  - ProjectName: 2023 Rabbit
    Nickname: Dalvory
    Description: In memory of the project that started in the year of Rabbit 2023!
  - ProjectName: Take-off your shoes Sign
    Nickname: Dalvory
    Description: I want to offer an experience at Yongsan Park where people can feel
      nature fully with bare feet.
  - ProjectName: Wall planter
    Nickname: Dalvory
    Description: It would be nice to have a space with a plant wall to preserve the
      beautiful ecosystem of the park.
  - ProjectName: Mini-waterfoutain
    Nickname: Dalvory
    Description: The small fountain quietly flowing, provides visitors to Yongsan
      Park with a peaceful time.
  - ProjectName: Hot air balloon
    Nickname: DY.Kim
    Description: I looked for those that matches with the park scenery among the
      toys in my room. I chose the Sylvanian Hot Air Balloon that initiates freedom
      through its sky adventure, as it seems to get along well with the atmosphere
      of Yongsan Park.
  - ProjectName: Anywhere Door
    Nickname: DY.Kim
    Description: I chose the "Anywhere Door" figure from anime Doraemon. This door
      allows us to move freely to any location. Parks are places where visitors are
      open to imagine anything, so I wanted to put up this as metaphor that help
      visitors to unfold their imagination.
  - ProjectName: Fan
    Nickname: DY.Kim
    Description: I wanted to put this item since it evokes the breeze blowing in
      the park.
  - ProjectName: Pikmin
    Nickname: DY.Kim
    Description: Pikmin is a Nintendo game character based on nature. I brought this
      with the thought of having Pikmin come alive through AR in the actual natural
      environment of Yongsan Park
  - ProjectName: Swings in the forest
    Nickname: DY.Kim
    Description: "Also, among the toys in my room, I searched for those that fit
      the park ambiance. I thought the \u2018Swings in the forest\u2019 would be
      suitable for the family-oriented atmosphere of the park. "
  - ProjectName: Bakhaus
    Nickname: creamT
    Description: To recover from fatigue, I always keep Bacchus by my side. I hope
      Yongsan Park becomes a small but effective place like Bacchus, where people
      can recover and refresh themselves.
  - ProjectName: Books
    Nickname: creamT
    Description: The books I referred to when studying and researching about Yongsan
      Park
  - ProjectName: Sneakers
    Nickname: creamT
    Description: I want to have a walk in a spacious park. It would be fun to have
      marathon course and hold a marathon event
  - ProjectName: Sae-woo-Kang(Shirmp Snack)
    Nickname: creamT
    Description: I like Sae-woo-kang so I want to take it to Yongsan Park
  - ProjectName: Yongsan Family Park
    Nickname: creamT
    Description: I enjoy spending time with my family and sometimes by myself, playing
      and exercising at Yongsan Family Park. I hope Yongsan Park becomes a place
      where people of all ages, including pets, can relax and have fun in nature.
